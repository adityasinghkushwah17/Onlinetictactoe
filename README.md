# Online Tic Tac Toe App

This is an online multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built using Kotlin. The application uses Ktor as the backend framework, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, WebSockets for real-time communication, and Kotlin serialization for data handling.


## Features

- Real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe gameplay.
- Secure WebSocket connections.
- Dependency injection with Dagger Hilt for modular and testable code.
- Clean and scalable architecture.
- Easy setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: Language used for both backend and frontend development.
- **Ktor**: Backend framework used for creating the server, routing, and handling WebSocket connections.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection framework used for managing dependencies.
- **WebSockets**: Used for real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: Library used for serializing and deserializing data sent over the network.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular and clean architecture, with the following components:

- **Backend**: Ktor handles HTTP requests, routing, and WebSocket connections.
- **Frontend**: The frontend interacts with the backend via WebSocket connections.
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger Hilt is used to inject dependencies across the application.
